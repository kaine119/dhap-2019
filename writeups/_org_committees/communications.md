The Communications subcommittee are delegates’ first and last points of contact - from being in charge of the first registration emails and subsequent follow-emails to website designs and general communication with delegates, they can be said to be with the delegates every step of the way. The team hopes that delegates will feel comfortable during DHAP 2019!
