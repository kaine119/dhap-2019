The Project Planning subcommittee helms the various ceremonies throughout your DHAP 2019 journey - spanning from the Opening Ceremony to Dinner and the Closing Ceremony. They promise to make delegates’ DHAP experience one worth remembering beyond council sessions with the various ceremonies! 

They look forward to meeting delegates at DHAP 2019 and hope that delegates will have a fulfilling and fun time.
